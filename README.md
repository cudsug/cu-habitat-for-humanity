# Analyzing Habitat for Humanity data

## Organization Name
 
## Overview
Habitat for Humanity of Champaign County builds and sells decent, quality, affordable houses to families at a zero percent interest rate.  They select families based on their level of need, willingness to partner with Habitat, acceptance of responsibilities, and ability to repay the mortgage.  They use the store front ReStore to generate revenues to cover virtually all the administrative costs of the affiliate allowing other donations to go directly to home building.

ReStore accepts donations of gently used furniture, appliances, electronics, household items and home improvement supplies.  They have over 15,000 square feet and are located in downtown Champaign.  They accept “just about everything – even the kitchen sink.”  They take donations Tuesday – Friday 10am-6pm and Saturday 10am-4pm.  ReStore has logs of their donations from July 2012 through the present, identifying the number of people who have donated by week if not day.

## Problem Statement
How can ReStore better solicit and support their donor community to both increase donations to ReStore and provide adequate staffing/hours to accept donations?  Are donations to ReStore trending up or down?  Are there certain days of the week or weeks of the year that are historically low or high volume such that Restore should adjust it staffing or hours?  Can anything be inferred about ReStore's donor profile given the geographic location of donors?
